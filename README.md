Code and **data** for the paper "Inferring causal networks using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps and evolutionary algorithms with application to gene regulatory network reconstruction" published in Applied Soft Computing. It was available online Sept. 7, 2015. Published in Dec. 2015.

Code needs to be further improved for readability. Data can be freely used to compare your algorithms with ours :)
